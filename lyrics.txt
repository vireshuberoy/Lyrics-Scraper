What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out?
You've got my head spinning, no kidding
I can't pin you downWhat's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alrightMy head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohHow many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too?
The world is beating you down
I'm around through every moodYou're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for youMy head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy, and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohGive me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of youI give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
